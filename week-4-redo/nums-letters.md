What is an integer? What is a float?

	integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal point. ie 5 is an integer while 5.0 is an float.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

	with integer division it will return the full number that it is divisible by without any remainder, while float division will return the actual number. ie 5 / 3 = 1 in integer division because 3 goes into 5 1 time. While it does have a remainder of 2, it technically is correct. with float division it will return  1.6666666...
