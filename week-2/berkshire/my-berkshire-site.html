<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It's actually pretty school. We think this is a pretty good refresher. The visualization
aspects of coding each tag and displaying it locally lets us pick up the learning curve
pretty quickly.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

We found plenty of materials online. Our main resource was from www.w3schools.com.
It's well documented with tags of all types for HTML 5.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We focused on the content of the site and not the styling. Other than that, it was
straight forward.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

Good:
-A simple site can be setup quickly.
-The site loads quickly if one is only interested in just content.

Bad:
-No sytling.
-Can look busy since it only has simple formating.
-Since typing the tags gets repetitive, it's easy to miss a closing tag at times which
can mess up the entire page.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
A cheap would be to have closing tag feature on your text editior. A good practice
would be to create open and close tags before entering content.
