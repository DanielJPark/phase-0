Describe what Open Source Means.

	Open source means that the program/code can be used freely by anyone. With an open source program, the creator openly and freely shares the code with the general public. Anyone can then download and use the program for free as well as modify the code as they see fit.




What do you think about Open Source? DOes it make you nervouse or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

	Personally as a user I love Open source. Really.. who doesn't LOVE free stuff? With that said at the same time I feel that as a programmer it would make me nervouse to just "give away" all of my code for free. I may be reluctant to give make my work Open Source at the risk of losing financial gains. Does that make me sound greedy?

Assess the importance of using licenses

	Licenses are important because it establishes your rights and ownership over the program/code that you have created. It also dictates what other users/devlopers can and cannot do with the code/program you have created.

What Concepts were solidified in the challenge? DId you have any "aha" moements? What did you struggle with?

	If definitely fee I am getting a better understanding on hot to use Git and Github. Git is something I am struggling with tremendously and feel like a need a little bit of hand holding. It was refershing to see the little bit of HTML code in the index file. I look forward to the unit on HTML and CSS.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better udnerstand a topic? If so, please list it.

	I didn't find any resource in particular however, I did google search how to do simple steps in git to help me through the uploading process. I was looking for the commandline prompts which were pretty easy to find. The magic of google!
