Release 1



1. What does puts do?

Puts returns the output to the screen and enters a new line.

2. What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a whole complete number where as a float a beverage that consists of soda pop and a scoop of icecream. Just kidding! 
A Float is a number that can have an additional fraction to it with a decimal point. For example 10 is an integer while 10.0 is a float.

3. What is the difference between float and intger division?
How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division is regular arithmatic division ie 10/5=2
Since computers only read in whole numbers (integers) integer division rounds down to the full number ie 11/5=2 not 11/5=2.2 The computer would only return 2 not 2.2. 

With float division the computer would return the decimal so with the same example 11.0/5.0=2.2.

Release 7



1. How does Ruby hand addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

	Ruby handles basic arithmatic like a calculator however.

2. What is the difference between integers and floats?

	An integer is a whole complete number where as a float is a number that can have an additional fraction to it with a decimal point. For example 10 is an integer while 10.0 is a float.

3. WHat is the difference between integer and float division?

	Integer division is division that outputs only whole numbers where as float division will output numbers beyond the decimal point.

4. What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

	Strings are a group of letters. They are needed when outputing text.

5. What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

	Local variables are variables that you give a direct assignment to. Using local variables makes writing code easier/more efficient because it is like entering a using a cookie cutter or a stamp as it enters certain information for you automatically instead of having to manually re-enter it.

6. How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of the basics?

	Yes. Its been a few weeks since I got to see/use Ruby and it was a much needed basic refresher. At times I got worried/confused in thinking that some of my attempted answers were too simple but then I realised that this was a BASICS refresher.
