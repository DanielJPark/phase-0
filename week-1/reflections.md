1.1 Think About Time

I found the sources in this assignment to be very interesting and relatable. I particularly enjoyed the video on creating a habit. Adding a small and simple positive habit immediately after a task that is already part of your daily routine is a very easy and effective way to incorporate a good habits into your daily routine. I found it interesting how simple and easy it could be to do. I also really like the way that Zed A. Shaw teaches the reader Ruby in his book "Learn Ruby the Hard Way." Shaw's approach of repetition and doing a task over and over again brings an old school Catholic School mentality to learning, that I feel is a very effective way to learn a new language. By being repetitive doing things habitually the tasks become second nature. These are all practices I lived and taught by when I was a classroom teacher. The concept of Time Boxing really struck a chord with me. I personally feel that I work best when I have a set schedule to follow. This format was very much part of like lifestyle when working as a school teacher. Its funny because we as humans are creatures of habit. On days when I was not working I would relate the time of day to the class period I would normally be teaching. Without this type of structure I definitely tend to procrastinate with my duties much more easily. During my summer vacations I would live freely and not abide by any sort of structured time schedule of "time boxing." While I definitely had much more "free time," I found that with the lack of a formally written structured schedule I was much less productive and definitely struggled to accomplish many simple tasks. With that being said I definitely plan to apply "Time Boxing" to my journey through Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. I plan on devoting sections of each week's assignments to 45 minute increments of each day. I hope that by foilowing this stucture I will become more efficeint in my learning as well as accomplishing the assigns tasks. 

1.2 The Command Line

I found this material to be somewhat difficult to follow, however was able to relate many of the commands that are typed into a shell to simple tasks that current computer users accomplish with their mouse on their computers and touch screens on their mobile devices. Its almost as if the Graphic User Interface we are all used to is a skin or layer on top of the shell that completes all the tasks we complete in everyday computing. With that being said...

What is a shell? What is "bash?"
A shell is a window in which users manually type in commands and processes for the computer to complete. It interprets the commands and then executes them. In Mac OSX the shell is the Terminal application.

Bash is the shell language that is currently used on Unix based operating systems. It is what many of the common coding languages are base off of.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
To be honest the most difficult part of this material was keeping track of all the moving text that was on the screen. The syntax looks like chicken scratch and can be a bit overwhelming to follow.

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes. I was somewhat familiar with typing in commands. I remember having to type commands into my friend’s old commodore 64 back when I was a child. Also in preparation for Devbootcamp, I read and completed the tutorials in Zed A Shaw’s “Learn Ruby the Hard Way”

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
pwd – Because it can be very easy to get lost while navigating the shell. Pwd will tell you exactly where you are!

Can you remember what each of the following does off the top of your head? Write what each does.
pwd – print working document

ls – list files in the directory

mv - move file

cd – change directory

../ - ??

touch – creates a new file

mkdir – creates a folder

less – ??

rmdir – removes a folder

rm – removes a file

help - ??
